### Class

This class is meant to be _hands on_. You will be learning how to critically think about, manipulate, visualize, and model data. Therefore, you are responsible for reading pertinent material prior to each class and  will need to bring your laptop to participate in the interactive coursework.

### Diversity & Inclusiveness

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

Furthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.) To help accomplish this:

- If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Wake Forest records, please let me know!
- If any of our class meetings conflict with your religious events, please let me know so that we can make arrangements for you.
- If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource. 
- I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.

### Disability Policy

Students with disabilities who believe that they may need accommodations in the class are encouraged to contact Learning Assistance Center & Disability Services at 336-758-5929 or [lacds@wfu.edu](mailto:lacds@wfu.edu) as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. 

### How to get help

#### Discussion:

All course discussion will be via Campuswire: [bit.ly/sta-212-f19-help](https://bit.ly/sta-212-f19-discuss) ([Sign up](https://bit.ly/sta-212-f19-discuss-join)). There are two ways to get help:

1. Post a question
2. Participate in a discussion room

Guidelines for posting questions:

* Before posting a question, be sure to search the previously posted questions in
* First time submitting something? Here are a few tips to keep in mind:
  * Give it a good and informative title!
  * Format it nicely using markdown including links and screenshots
 
####  Math & Stats Center:

* Located in Kirby Hall 117
* Study sessions: (beginning Sept 3) Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday 7-9pm
* Make an appointment: (beginning Sept 10) [https://mathandstatscenter.wfu.edu/](https://mathandstatscenter.wfu.edu/)


Please also make use of our office hours - we are here to help you learn! 

### Honor code

Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. For other information on these matters, please consult the [Code of Conduct](https://studentconduct.wfu.edu/undergraduate-student-handbook/). For Academic issues please see the [College Judicial System](https://studentconduct.wfu.edu/the-judicial-council/).

#### Sharing code & responses

* There are many online resources for sharing code (for example, StackOverflow) - you **may** use these resources but **must explicitly cite** where you have obtained code (both code you used directly and "paraphrased" code / code used as inspiration). Any reused code that is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.
* You **may** discuss the content of assignments with others in this class. If you do so, please acknowledge your collaborator(s) at the top of your assignment, for example: "Collaborators: Gertrude Cox, Florence Nightingale David". Failure to acknowledge collaborators will result in a grade of 0. You **may not** copy code and/or answers **directly** from another student. If you copy someone else's work, both parties will receive a grade of 0.
* Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in this course!

### Course components

#### Application exercises

These will usually start in class and can be assigned to be finished by the next class meeting. 

#### Homework

Problem sets from the textbook will be assigned periodically, potentially along with additional questions. You are welcome to work on these with other members of this class. If you do so, please acknowledge your collaborator(s) at the top of your assignment, for example: "Collaborators: Gertrude Cox, Florence Nightingale David". Failure to acknowledge collaborators will result in a grade of 0. You **may not** copy answers **directly** from another student. If you copy someone else's work, both parties will receive a grade of 0.

Homework with the lowest score for each student will be dropped.

#### Labs

The objective of the labs is to give you hands on experience with data analysis using modern statistical software. The labs will also provide you with tools that you will need to complete the project successfully.

The lab with the lowest score for each student will be dropped.

#### Unannounced Quizzes

Classes will periodically have an unannounced quiz on the topics previously covered. These will be short (~10 minute) quizzes designed to ensure that you are doing the reading / following the material covered. 

Quizzes cannot be made up. It is expected that you may miss a quiz due to missing class a time or two; to account for this, two quizzes for each student will be dropped.

#### Pyramid Exams

There will be two midterm exams. They will both consist of 2 stages.

* Part 1 is individual, in-class, timed work.
* Part 2 is individual, take-home, open everything and everyone **outside this class**. Seriously. Talk to people. Search the web. Figure it out and get it right. Just remember, you are academics; always cite your sources. It's always better to over-cite than to show-off.

#### Final Project

For the Final project, you will be responsible for the completion of an open ended project. You may work with one or two classmates on the final project, if you choose. Additional details on the projects will be provided as the course progresses.

#### Interactive tutorials

These are self-paced interactive tutorials that will be assigned intermittently throughout the semester. They will be graded on a check/no check basis (though you'll receive feedback on the way as you complete them) and they will count towards extra credit.

### Grading

Your final grade will be comprised of the following:

{.table .table-condensed .table-striped .text-left}
 <span></span>        | <span></span>
----------------------|----------------
Participation & application exercises       | 5%
Quizzes               | 10%
Homework              | 15%
Labs                  | 10%
Midterm exam 1        | 20%
Midterm exam 2        | 20%
Final project         | 20%

Class attendance in lecture and lab is a firm expectation; frequent absences or tardiness will be considered a legitimate cause for grade reduction.

### Late / missed work

- Late work policy for homework assignments and labs:
    - late, but within 24 hours of due date/time: -50%
    - any later: no credit
    
- Late work will not be accepted for exams or projects.

- No make-up quizzes will be given.

- Exam dates cannot be changed and no make-up exams will be given. If the midterm exam (part 1) must be missed, absence must be officially excused in advance of the due date, in which case the missing exam score will be imputed using the other (part 1) exam score and a scaling factor. This policy only applies to the midterms.

- You must complete the final project and be in class to present it in order to pass this course.

- All regrade requests must be discussed with the professor within one week of receiving your grade. There will be no grade changes after the final project.

### Professionalism

- Please refrain from texting or using your computer for anything other than coursework during class.
