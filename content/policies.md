### Class

This class is meant to be _hands on_. You will be learning how to critically think about, manipulate, visualize, and model data. Therefore, you are responsible for reading pertinent material prior to each class and  will need to bring your laptop to participate in the interactive coursework.

### Diversity & Inclusiveness

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

Furthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.) To help accomplish this:

- If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Wake Forest records, please let me know!
- If any of our class meetings conflict with your religious events, please let me know so that we can make arrangements for you.
- If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource. 
- I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.

### Disability Policy

Students with disabilities who believe that they may need accommodations in the class are encouraged to contact Learning Assistance Center & Disability Services at 336-758-5929 or [lacds@wfu.edu](mailto:lacds@wfu.edu) as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. 

### How to get help

All course discussion will be via GitHub on the [Sta-212-f19/community](https://github.com/sta-212-f19/community) repository. This is a public discussion forum, which means others outside of the course can stumble upon it and help you as well.

Guidelines for posting questions:

* Before posting a question, be sure to search the previously posted issues in the search bar above. Note that questions that have been answered will be in _closed issues_, do not forget to search these before posting. If you do not think a question has been answered well, feel free to re-open the issue.
* To start a new discussion or post a new question, create a [new issue](https://github.com/sta-212-f19/community/issues/new).
* First time submitting something? Check out [Writing a proper GitHub issue](https://medium.com/nyc-planning-digital/writing-a-proper-github-issue-97427d62a20f). It is written broadly for GitHub issues, but many of the main points apply here. Here are a few of the key take aways to keep in mind:
  * Give it a good and informative title! 
  * Format it nicely using markdown including links and screenshots
  * Be sure to tag relevant participants using their GitHub handles, for example if you want to tag Dr. D'Agostino McGowan, use `@LucyMcGowan`
* Be sure to click "Submit a new issue" when you're ready to post your question

Please also make use of our office hours - we are here to help you learn! 

### Honor code:

Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. For other information on these matters, please consult the [Code of Conduct](https://studentconduct.wfu.edu/undergraduate-student-handbook/). For Academic issues please see the [College Judicial System](https://studentconduct.wfu.edu/the-judicial-council/).

#### Sharing code & responses

* There are many online resources for sharing code (for example, StackOverflow) - you **may** use these resources but **must explicitly cite** where you have obtained code (both code you used directly and "paraphrased" code / code used as inspiration). Any reused code that is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.
* You **may** discuss the content of assignments with others in this class. If you do so, please acknowledge your collaborator(s) at the top of your assignment, for example: "Collaborators: Gertrude Cox, Florence Nightingale David". Failure to acknowledge collaborators will result in a grade of 0. You **may not** copy code and/or answers **directly** from another student. If you copy someone else's work, both parties will receive a grade of 0.
* Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in this course!

### Course components:

#### Teams

To construct functional and diverse teams, you will be asked to complete a short survey to gauge your previous exposure to statistical and programming topics. After completing the survey, you will be assigned to teams of 3-4 students - these teams will stay consistent throughout the semester. You will work in these teams during class, on application exercises, and on labs.

#### Application exercises

These will usually start in class and can be assigned to be finished by the next class meeting. They will generally be shorter than your homework assignments, and they will be completed in teams.

#### Homework

Beyond the in class activities, you will be assigned homework throughout the semester. These assignments will be completed individually. 

Homework with the lowest score for each student will be dropped.

#### Labs

The objective of the labs is to give you hands on experience with data analysis using modern statistical software. The labs will also provide you with tools that you will need to complete the project successfully.

All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment and you will be asked to evaluate your team members after a few assignments are due.

Students are expected to make use of their team's GitHub repository on the course's GitHub page as their central collaborative platform. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member's relative contribution for each lab.

The lab with the lowest score for each student will be dropped.

#### Pyramid Exams

There will be two midterm exams. They will both consist of 3 stages.

* Part 1 is individual, in-class, timed work.
* Part 2 is individual, take-home, open everything and everyone **outside this class**. Seriously. Talk to people. Search the web. Figure it out and get it right. Just remember, you are academics; always cite your sources. It's always better to over-cite than to show-off.
* Part 3 is large scale collaborative work, the whole class, one exam, figure out how to all work together to get it perfect.

#### Final Project

For the Final project, you will be responsible for the completion of an open ended project - you can choose the data and the question. You may work with one classmate on the final project, if you choose. Additional details on the projects will be provided as the course progresses.

#### Interactive tutorials

These are self-paced interactive tutorials that will be assigned intermittently throughout the semester. They will be graded on a check/no check basis (though you'll receive feedback on the way as you complete them) and they will count towards extra credit.

### Grading

Your final grade will be comprised of the following:

{.table .table-condensed .table-striped .text-left}
 <span></span>        | <span></span>
----------------------|----------------
Participation & application exercises       | 10%
Peer evaluation       | 5%
Homework              | 20%
Labs                  | 15%
Midterm exam 1          | 15%
Midterm exam 2         | 15%
Final project         | 20%

Class attendance in lecture and lab is a firm expectation; frequent absences or tardiness will be considered a legitimate cause for grade reduction.

Cumulative numerical averages of 90 - 100 are guaranteed at least an A-, 80 - 89 at least a B-, and 70 - 79 at least a C-, however the exact ranges for letter grades will be determined after the final exam.

### Late / missed work

- Late work policy for homework assignments and labs:
    - late, but within 24 hours of due date/time: -20%
    - any later: no credit
    
- Late work will not be accepted for exams or projects.

- Exam dates cannot be changed and no make-up exams will be given. If the midterm exam must be missed, absence must be officially excused in advance of the due date, in which case the missing exam score will be imputed using the other exam score. This policy only applies to the midterms.

- You must complete the final project and be in class to present it in order to pass this course.

- All regrade requests must be discussed with the professor within one week of receiving your grade. There will be no grade changes after the final project.

### Professionalism

- Please refrain from texting or using your computer for anything other than coursework during class.
