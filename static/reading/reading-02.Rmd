```

## Due

Tuesday, Sep 3

## Required:

- [Elements and Principles of Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.07639.pdf)

## Optional:

- [ggplot2 in 2](https://leanpub.com/ggplot2in2/c/sta-212-f19)
- If you are looking for a little more practice with R, you can try out the **swirl** package. This is a package that allows you to learn R from within R. Open RStudio Cloud (https://rstudio.cloud) and click on the STA 212 - Fall 19 workspace. Open a new project and run the following in the console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(swirl)
install_course_github("swirldev", "R_Programming_E")
swirl()
```

This will start a tutorial that you can follow along with. Keep in mind that this may cover more than you need for this course.
