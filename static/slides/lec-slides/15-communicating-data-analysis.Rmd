## Agenda

* Updating your `yaml` 
* Putting all code in the appendix
* Hiding messages and warnings from your package loadings
* Hiding interactive output
* Creating pretty tables
* Creating figure and table caption
* Putting intermediate figures at the end
* Including citations

---

## Updating your `yaml`

* For the final project I want you to create .pdf files.

```{yaml}
---
title: "The title of your document"
name: "Your name"
output: pdf_document #<<
---
```

---

## Updating your `yaml`

* For the final project I want you to create .pdf files.

```{yaml}
---
title: "The title of your document"
name: "Your name"
output: pdf_document 
fontsize: 12pt #<<
---
```

* 12 pt font

---

## Updating your `yaml`

* For the final project I want you to create .pdf files.

```{yaml}
---
title: "The title of your document"
name: "Your name"
output: pdf_document 
fontsize: 12pt
linestretch: 2 #<<
---
```

* 12 pt font
* Double spaced

---

## Putting all code in the Appendix

* For these fancy reports, we want to see the R code, but we don't want it intersperced throughout the document. 
* You can "hide" all of your chunks by adding this to the top of your .Rmd file

.small[
````
`r ''````{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```
````
]

--

* **THEN** at the end of you document (in the Appendix) you can add

.small[
````
`r ''````{r ref.label=knitr::all_labels(), echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
```
````
]

---

## Hiding messages and warnings from your package loadings

* You can hide any messages or warnings by updating the chunk options

.small[
````
`r ''````{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```
````
]

---

## Hiding interactive output

* If you are running "interactive code", that is code that is not saved to an object in `R`, it will print in your output, even if you hide the _code_ with `echo = FALSE`. For example:

.small[
```{r}
glimpse(iris)
```
]

--

* Use the `results = "hide"` in the chunk options to _hide_ it.

.small[
````
`r ''````{r, results = "hide"}
glimpse(iris)
```
````
]

---

## Creating pretty tables

* We've been using the `tidy()` and `glance()` functions to print tables of our model output.
* These kind of look like "code" in our final reports
* We can make these prettier with the **knitr** package

--
* Load the **knitr** package with `library(knitr)`
* Use the `kable()` function to output a pretty table

.small[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(knitr) #<<
lm(wt ~ am, data = mtcars) %>%
  tidy() %>%
  kable() #<<
```
]
.small[
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(knitr) 
lm(wt ~ am, data = mtcars) %>%
  tidy() %>%
  kable(format = "html") 
```
]
---

## Creating table captions


.small[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(knitr) 
lm(wt ~ am, data = mtcars) %>%
  tidy() %>%
  kable(caption = "Predicting Car's weight from transmission type") #<<
```
]
.small[
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(knitr) 
lm(wt ~ am, data = mtcars) %>%
  tidy() %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Table 1. Predicting Car's weight from transmission type") 
```
]
---

## Creating figure captions

* If you have an `R` chunck that produces a Figure, you can caption it using the `fig.cap` chunk option. For example:

.small[
```{r, fig.cap = "Scatterplot of Miles per gallon by Displacement", fig.height = 1.5}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = disp)) +
  geom_point()
```
]
.center[Figure 1. Scatterplot of Miles per gallon by Displacement]

.small[
````
`r ''````{r, fig.cap = "Scatterplot of Miles per gallon by Displacement"}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = disp)) +
  geom_point()
```
````
]

---

## Putting extra figures at the end of your document

* Your prompt tells you to put all "intermediate" figures in the appendix
  * This includes figures that you used to check the assumptions of the models that were _not_ the final model
* To do this:
  * Save your figures as `R` objects
  * Create code chunks at the **beginning** of the Appendix that run these objects (with captions)

---

## Putting extra figures at the end of your document

* Save the plot to an `R` object, `p`

```{r}
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, disp)) +
  geom_point()
```

--

* Put this `R` object, `p` in a chunk at the beginning of your Appendix

.small[
````
`r ''````{r, fig.cap = "Scatterplot of Miles per gallon by Displacement"}
p
```
````
]

## Citations

* Your introduction should cite prior research in the area of your research question
* You will need to create a `citations.bib` file with citations, and then reference them using `[@citation]`

---

## Citations 

* Create a `citations.bib` file in your RStudio project
  * Go to File > New File > Text File and click
  
.center[

## Citations

* This bibliography is using `BibTex`, which is a certain way citations are saved in Latex
* Your `citations.bib` is going to be a file with multiple `BibTex` entries
* You can get `Bibtex` entries from Google Scholar
  * Search for the article you'd like to cite
  * Under the article there will be `"`, click that
