## Variable types

* There are two major classes of variables
  * numeric (quantitative) 
  * categorical

---

## Variable types

* Recall from the first week of class, you can use the `glimpse()` function to see all of your variables and their types

--

.small[
```{r, echo = TRUE}
data("PorschePrice")
glimpse(PorschePrice)
```
]

--

* What are the variables here?

.small[
```{r, echo = TRUE}
data("Diamonds")
glimpse(Diamonds)
```
]

--

* What are the variables here?

--
* `fct`: "factor" this is a type of categorical variable

## Variable types

.small[
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
glimpse(starwars)
```
]

.small[
```{r}
glimpse(starwars[, 1:5])
```
]

--

* `chr`: "character" this is a type of categorical variable

---

## Variable types

* So far, our models have only included _numeric_ (_quantitative_) variables
--

  * What would the equation be for predicting $y$ from $x$ when $x$ is numeric?
--

* What would happen if $x$ is categorical?
--

  * What would the equation be for predicting $y$ from $x$ if $x$ is categorical with 2 levels?
--

  * What would the equation be for predicting $y$ from $x$ if $x$ is categorical with 3 levels?

## indicator variable

An **indicator variable** uses two values, usually 0 and 1, to indicate whether a data case does (1) or does not (0) belong to a specific category

---

```{r, echo = TRUE}
data("Diamonds")
```

.small[
```{r}
Diamonds %>% 
  select(TotalPrice, Color, Carat) %>%
  DT::datatable()
```
]

---

## Indicator variables

.question[
What does this line of code do?
]
```{r, echo = TRUE}
Diamonds <- Diamonds %>%
  mutate(
    ColorD = ifelse(Color == "D", 1, 0), #<<
    ColorE = ifelse(Color == "E", 1, 0),
    ColorF = ifelse(Color == "F", 1, 0),
    ColorG = ifelse(Color == "G", 1, 0),
    ColorH = ifelse(Color == "H", 1, 0),
    ColorI = ifelse(Color == "I", 1, 0),
    ColorJ = ifelse(Color == "J", 1, 0)
  )
```

## Indicator variables

.question[
What if I wanted to model the relationship between `TotalPrice` and `Color`?
]

.small[
```{r}
Diamonds %>%
  select(TotalPrice, Carat, Color, ColorD, ColorE, ColorF, ColorG, ColorH, ColorI) %>%
  DT::datatable(options = list(pageLength = 5))
```
]

---

## Indicator variables

.question[
Why is `ColorJ` `NA`?
]

.small[
```{r, echo = TRUE, highlight.output = c(9, 10)}
lm(TotalPrice ~ ColorD + ColorE + ColorF + ColorG + ColorH + ColorI + ColorJ,
   data = Diamonds)
```
]

--

* When including indicator variables in a model for `k` categories, always include `k-1` 
--

* The one that is left out is the "reference" category

---

## Indicator variables

.question[
What is the reference category?
]

.small[
```{r, echo = TRUE}
lm(TotalPrice ~ ColorD + ColorE + ColorF + ColorG + ColorH + ColorI,
   data = Diamonds)
```
]

--

* **Interpretation:** A diamond with Color `D` compared to color `J` increases the expected total price by 3632.
--

* **Interpretation:** A diamond with Color `E` compared to color `J` increases the expected total price by 2423

* **Interpretation:** A diamond with Color `D` compared to color `J` increases the expected total price by 3632.
* What is the interpretation for a diamond with Color `F`?

.question[

]
.small[
```{r, echo = TRUE}
lm(TotalPrice ~ Color, data = Diamonds)
```
]

--

* What is the interpretation for Color `E` now?

--
* What if we wanted a different referent category?

--
  * We could code the indicators ourselves
  
--
  * We could use the **forcats**

---

## forcats

.pull-right[
![](img/09/forcats-logo.png)
]

* R uses factors to handle categorical variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values. 
* The **forcats** package is loaded with the **tidyverse**, it helps you do things like order your factors

Source: [forcats.tidyverse.org](forcats.tidyverse.org)

---

## forcats

```{r, echo = TRUE}
levels(Diamonds$Color)
```

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
new_levels <- c("J", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I")
Diamonds <- Diamonds %>%
  mutate(Color = fct_relevel(Color, new_levels))
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
levels(Diamonds$Color)

## What if the variable is **binary**

* A **binary** variable is a special type of categorical variable with **two levels**

---

## ICU example

* A sample of 200 patients in an ICU unit
* Want to see if the patient's heart rate is related to whether they were admitted via the emergency room 
--

  * y: Heart rate (beats per minute)
  * x: indicator for emergency room admission
--

* Aside: Is this inference or prediction?

---

## Binary x variable

```{r, echo = TRUE}
data("ICU")
lm(Pulse ~ Emergency, data = ICU)
```

--

* How can we interpret $\hat{\beta}_0$ now?
--

* How can we interpret $\hat{\beta}_1$?
