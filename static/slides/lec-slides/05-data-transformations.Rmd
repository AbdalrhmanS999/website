Number of MDs and community hospitals for sample of 83 metropolitan areas

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(Stat2Data)
library(tidyverse)
data("MetroHealth83")
```

## Choose

* to **stabilize** the variance of the response ( $y$, in this case `NumMDs`) across different values of the predictor ( $x$, in this case `NumHospitals`), we can **transform** $y$ or $x$
--

* typical transformations: 
    * $\sqrt{y}$
    * $\log{y}$
    * $x^2$
    * $1/x$
--
* For count data, such as the number of doctors or hospitals where the variability increases along with the magnitudes of the variables, a **square root transformation** is often helpful
