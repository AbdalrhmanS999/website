## Adjusting for confounders

* I fit a linear model for `\(\hat{sat} = \hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1 salary\)`


```
## # A tibble: 2 x 5
##   term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value
##   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;

## 2 salary         -5.54      1.63     -3.39 1.39e- 3
```


--

* How do we interpret this result?

---

## Adjusting for confounders

* There is a **third variable**, the fraction of students that took the SAT in that state. It is grouped as "Low", "Medium", and, "High".


```
## # A tibble: 4 x 5
##   term          estimate std.error statistic  p.value
##   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;

* What is the referent category?
--

* How do you interpret the `\(\hat{\beta}\)` for `frac_groupLOW`?
--

* How do you interpret the `\(\hat{\beta}\)` for `salary` now?

class: middle

## `\(\hat\beta\)` interpretation in multiple linear regression

The coefficient for `\(x\)` is `\(\hat\beta\)` (95% CI: `\(LB_\hat\beta, UB_\hat\beta\)`). A one-unit increase in `\(x\)` yields an expected increase in y of `\(\hat\beta\)`, **holding all other variables constant**.

---

class: middle

## `\(\hat\beta\)` interpretation in multiple linear regression

The coefficient for average salary is 1.09 (95% CI: -0.90, 3.08).  A one-unit increase in average salary yields an expected increase in average SAT score of 1.09, **holding the fraction of students that took the SAT constant**.

* What is this called? Where the direction reverses?
--

* Notice here the lines are **parallel** so holding the group constant, this is the effect we see.

* ðŸ˜± what if the lines aren't parallel?

## `\(\hat\beta\)` interpretation for interactions between `\(x\)` and a binary indicator `\(I\)`

The coefficient for the interaction between `\(x\)` and `\(I\)` is `\(\hat\beta\)` (95% CI: `\(LB_\hat\beta, UB_\hat\beta\)`). This means that the effect of `\(x\)` on `\(y\)` differs by `\(\hat\beta\)` when `\(I = 1\)` compared to `\(I = 0\)` **holding all other variables constant***.

--
* You must include this line if there are **additional variables in your model**.

---

class: middle

## `\(\hat\beta\)` interpretation for interactions between `\(x\)` and a binary indicator `\(I\)`

The coefficient for the interaction between `Age` and `Sex` is -0.28 (95% CI: -0.44, -0.12). This means that the effect of `Age` on `Weight` lower by 0.28 among girls compared to boys.

---

## Non-linear relationships

* Sometimes the relationships between the outcome `\(y\)` and `\(x\)` variables are _nonlinear_. 
* We can use _polynomials_ to address this!
* Returning to the **Diamonds** data, let's say we are interested in predicting Total Price from the Carats.

--
  * Is this an example of inference or prediction?

## Interpreting `\(\hat\beta\)`s in the presence of polynomials

`\(Total Price = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Carat + \beta_2 Carat^2 + \epsilon\)`

* What is the interpretation of `\(\hat\beta_1\)`?

--
* Typically, in multiple linear regression, the interpretation of `\(\hat\beta_i\)` is:
a one-unit change in `\(x\)` yields an expected change in `\(y\)` of `\(\hat\beta_i\)` **holding all other variables constant**.

--
  * What does it mean to see a change in `Caret` holding `Carat` `\(^2\)` constant?

--
* When you have a polynomial term, you need to **specify the values you are changing between**, since the change is no longer constant across all values of `\(x\)`.

---
## Interpreting `\(\hat\beta\)` in the presence of polynomials

* `\(\hat\beta\)` coefficients that are transformations of the same `\(x\)` variable **must** be interpreted together

--
* You must first choose to values of `\(x\)` to change between, and then report the change. 

--
* A sensible choice for the two `\(x\)` values can be the 25th% quantile and the 75th% quantile.

## General `\(\hat\beta\)` interpretation with quadratic terms

The linear term in the model for `\(x\)` has a coefficient of `\(\hat\beta_1\)` (95% CI: `\((LB_{\hat\beta_1}, UB_{\hat\beta_1})\)`). The quadratic term in the model for `\(x\)` has a coefficient of `\(\hat\beta_2\)` (95% CI: `\((LB_{\hat\beta_2}, UB_{\hat\beta_2})\)`). A change in `\(x\)` from `\(a\)` to `\(b\)` yields an expected change in `\(y\)` of `\(\hat\beta_1 (b - a) + \hat\beta_2 (b^2 - a^2)\)` **holding all other variables constant***.

* You must include this line if there are **additional variables in your model**.

## Specific `\(\hat\beta\)` interpretation for `\(y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Carat + \beta_2 Carat^2 + \epsilon\)` model

The linear term in the model for `Carat` has a coefficient of 2386 (95% CI: `\((906, 3866)\)`). The quadratic term in the model for `Carat` has a coefficient of `\(4498\)` (95% CI: `\((3981, 5016)\)`). A change in `Carat` from `\(0.7\)` to `\(1.24\)` yields an expected change in `TotalPrice` of `\(6000.5\)`.

* Why didn't I say **holding all other variables constant?**

## Take aways

* The interpretation of `\(\hat\beta\)` in multiple linear regression
  * A one-unit change in `\(x\)` yields an expected change in `\(y\)` of `\(\hat\beta\)` **holding all other included variables constant**

--
* If the _slope differs_ between groups (the lines cross in a scatterplot), an **interaction** is present

--
* You can include polynomial terms to address **non-linear** relationships

--
  * The coefficients for a polynomial must be interpreted together
