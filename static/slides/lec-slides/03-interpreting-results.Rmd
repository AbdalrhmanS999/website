## Interpreting Results

There are 3 unknowns in a simple linear regression that we are **estimating**:

* $\Large\hat{\beta}_0$
* $\Large\hat{\beta}_1$
* $\Large\hat{\sigma}_\epsilon$

Let's talk about what they mean in _words_

---

## Interpreting Results

$\Large \hat{\textrm{Weight}} = \hat{\beta_0}+ \hat{\beta_1}\textrm{Wing Length} + \epsilon$

```{r}
lm(Weight ~ WingLength, data = Sparrows)
```

---

## Interpreting Results

$\Large \hat{\textrm{Weight}} = \hat{\beta_0}+ \hat{\beta_1}\textrm{Wing Length} + \epsilon$

```{r}
lm(Weight ~ WingLength, data = Sparrows)
```

.question[
How can we end up with just $\hat{\beta}_0$ on one side of the equation?
]

## $\hat{\beta}_0$ is the expected mean value of $y$ when $x$ is 0

---

## Interpreting Results

$\Large \hat{\textrm{Weight}} = \hat{\beta_0}+ \hat{\beta_1}\textrm{Wing Length} + \epsilon$

```{r}
lm(Weight ~ WingLength, data = Sparrows)
```

.question[
What does $\hat{\beta}_0$ mean here?
]

---

## Interpreting Results

$\Large \hat{\textrm{Weight}} = \hat{\beta_0}+ \hat{\beta_1}\textrm{Wing Length} + \epsilon$

```{r}
lm(Weight ~ WingLength, data = Sparrows)
```

.question[
How do we interpret $\hat{\beta}_1$?
]

---

class: center, middle

## For every one unit change in $x$ the expected mean value of $y$ changes by $\hat{\beta}_1$.

---

## Interpreting Results

$\Large \hat{\textrm{Weight}} = \hat{\beta_0}+ \hat{\beta_1}\textrm{Wing Length} + \epsilon$

```{r}
lm(Weight ~ WingLength, data = Sparrows)
```

.question[
What does $\hat{\beta}_1$ mean here?
]

---

## Interpreting Results

```{r}
Sparrows %>%
  mutate(y_hat = lm(Weight ~ WingLength, data = Sparrows) %>% predict(),
         residuals_2 = (Weight - y_hat)^2) %>%
  summarise(rse = sqrt(sum(residuals_2) / (n() - 2)))
```

.question[
What is the interpretation of the regression (residual) standard error?
]
---

class: center, middle

## $\hat{\sigma}_\epsilon$ is the "typical error"

---

## Interpreting Results

```{r, echo = FALSE}
Sparrows %>%
  mutate(y_hat = lm(Weight ~ WingLength, data = Sparrows) %>% predict(),
         residuals_2 = (Weight - y_hat)^2) %>%
  summarise(rse = sqrt(sum(residuals_2) / (n() - 2)))
```

```{r}
y_hat <- lm(Weight ~ WingLength, data = Sparrows) %>% 
  predict()

Sparrows %>%
  mutate(residual = Weight - y_hat) %>%
  select(Weight, residual) %>%
  slice(1:5)
```
