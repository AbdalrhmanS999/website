What do you think would be on the x-axis and y-axis on a "residuals versus fits" plot?
]

# Linearity & Constant Variance

```{r, echo = FALSE}
Sparrows <- Sparrows %>%
  mutate(y_hat = lm(Weight ~ WingLength, data = Sparrows) %>% predict(),
         residuals = Weight - y_hat) 
  
ggplot(Sparrows, aes(x = y_hat, y = residuals)) +

# Linearity & Constant Variance

### Residuals versus fits plot: What are we looking for?

* random variation above and below 0
* no apparent "patterns"
* the width of the "band" of points is relatively constant
