# Odds ratios

A study investigated whether a handheld device that sends a magnetic pulse into a person’s head
might be an effective treatment for migraine headaches.

* Researchers recruited 200 subjects who suffered from migraines 
* randomly assigned them to receive either the TMS (transcranial magnetic
stimulation) treatment or a placebo treatment 
* Subjects were instructed to apply the device at the onset of migraine symptoms and then assess how they felt two hours later. (either **Pain-free** or **Not pain-free**)

* We can compare the results using **odds**

--
* What are the odds of being pain-free for the placebo group?

--
  * `\((22/100)/(78/100) = 22/78 = 0.282\)`

--
* What are the odds of being pain-free for the treatment group?

--
  * `\(39/61 = 0.639\)`

--
* Comparing the **odds** what can we conclude?

--
  * TMS increases the likelihood of success

Pain-free two hours later |39| 22 |61

`\(\Large OR = \frac{39/61}{22/78} = \frac{0.639}{0.282} = 2.27\)`

Not pain-free two hours later |61 |78| 139

`\(\Large OR = \frac{61/39}{78/22} = \frac{1.564}{3.545} = 0.441\)`

_the odds for still being in pain for the TMS group are 0.441 times the odds of being in pain for the placebo group_

# Odds ratios

* In general, it's more natural to interpret odds ratios &gt; 1, you can flip the referent to do so

|TMS | Placebo| Total
---|---|----|---
Pain-free two hours later |39| 22 |61
Not pain-free two hours later |61 |78| 139
Total| 100| 100 |200


`\(\Large OR = \frac{78/22}{61/39} = \frac{3.545}{1.564} = 2.27\)`


_the odds for still being in pain for the placebo group are 2.27 times the odds of being in pain for the TMS group_
