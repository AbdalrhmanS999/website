## Variable types

* There are two major classes of variables
  * numeric (quantitative) 
  * categorical

---

## Variable types

* Recall from the first week of class, you can use the `glimpse()` function to see all of your variables and their types

## Variable types

* So far, our models have only included _numeric_ (_quantitative_) variables
--

  * What would the equation be for predicting `\(y\)` from `\(x\)` when `\(x\)` is numeric?
--

* What would happen if `\(x\)` is categorical?
--

  * What would the equation be for predicting `\(y\)` from `\(x\)` if `\(x\)` is categorical with 2 levels?
--

  * What would the equation be for predicting `\(y\)` from `\(x\)` if `\(x\)` is categorical with 3 levels?

class: middle

## indicator variable

An **indicator variable** uses two values, usually 0 and 1, to indicate whether a data case does (1) or does not (0) belong to a specific category

## What if the variable is **binary**

* A **binary** variable is a special type of categorical variable with **two levels**

---

## ICU example

* A sample of 200 patients in an ICU unit
* Want to see if the patient's heart rate is related to whether they were admitted via the emergency room 
--

  * y: Heart rate (beats per minute)
  * x: indicator for emergency room admission
--

* Aside: Is this inference or prediction?

---

## Binary x variable


```r
data("ICU")
lm(Pulse ~ Emergency, data = ICU)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = Pulse ~ Emergency, data = ICU)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)    Emergency  
##       91.11        10.63
```
