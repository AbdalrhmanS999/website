# Agenda

* **Loading a .csv file**
* **(Re)coding factor variables**
* **Lab 05:** on your own

---

## Reading in a .csv file

* So far, the data we've been using has been included in an **R package**
* To access this data we just run `data("data set")`
* What if we want to read in other data, for example from a `.csv` file?
--

* enter: `read_csv()`
--

* `read_csv()` is a function from the **readr** package, which is included when you load the **tidyverse**
--

* it works like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
df <- read_csv("the-path-to-your-file.csv")
```

Where `df` can be whatever you'd like to call your new dataset

---

## Recoding factor variables

* Sometimes variables come in as _numeric_, but we want them to be factors

---

## Recoding factor variables

* This dataset contains data on a sample of 1450 birth records that statistician John Holcomb selected from the North Carolina State Center for Health and Environmental Statistics.

```{r, highlight.output = 9}
glimpse(NCbirths)
```

---

## Recoding factor variables

```{r}
lm(BirthWeightOz ~ RaceMom, data = NCbirths)
```

---

## Recoding factor variables


```{r}
NCbirths <- NCbirths %>%
  mutate(
    RaceMom = recode_factor(
      RaceMom,
      `1` = "white",
      `2` = "black",
      `3` = "American Indian",
      `4` = "Chinese",
      `5` = "Japanese",
      `6` = "Hawaiian",
      `7` = "Filipino",
      `8` = "Other Asian or Pacific Islander"
    )
  )
```

---

## Recoding factor variables

```{r}
lm(BirthWeightOz ~ RaceMom, data = NCbirths)
```

--

* What is the referent category?

--
* What if I wanted to change that?
---

## Recoding factor variables

```{r}
new_levels <- c("American Indian", "white", "black",  "Chinese", "Japanese", "Filipino", "Other Asian or Pacific Islander")
NCbirths <- NCbirths %>%
  mutate(
    RaceMom = fct_relevel(RaceMom, new_levels)
  )
```

## Recoding factor variables

* Sometimes variables come in as _numeric_, but we want them to be factors

## Open `Lab 05: multiple regression` in RStudio
