# Lab 00: Logistics
### 2019-08-22

---





class: center, middle

# Welcome to lab

---

## Who are you?

Your name, year, major / intended major, something else you'd like to share?

---

## R is cool!

---

## Goals

- Introduce you to R and RStudio:
    + R is the name of the programming language itself 
    + RStudio is a convenient interface

- Introduce you to Git and GitHub: collaboration and version control system that we will be using throughout the course
    + Git is a version control system -- like "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word on steroids
    + GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet -- like DropBox but much, much better

---

## Outline

1. Questions on course policies
2. GitHub accounts
3. Asking for help
4. Getting to know you survey
5. RStudio Cloud accounts
6. Integrate GitHub / RStudio Cloud / R
7. Do the lab!

---

## 1. Any questions on course policies?

Make sure to review the syllabus and policies at [bit.ly/sta-212-f19](http://bit.ly/sta-212-f19).

---

## 2. GitHub accounts

- If you have a GitHub account, note your username (you'll need it for the survey), and sit back and relax for a minute.

- If you do not yet have a GitHub account, create one at https://github.com/. Tips for selecting a username:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

- Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they’re dealing with + makes it easier for people to guess or remember.
- Reuse your username from other contexts if you can, e.g., Twitter
- Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
- Shorter is better than longer.
- Make it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, etc.
- Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming, like `NA`.

## 3. Posting on the discussion forum

- Go to https://github.com/sta-212-f19/community and bookmark this page.

- In the issues tab find the issue I created and click on it.

- Respond to it with a hello, or something else. Feel free to add some code formatted text, inline surrounded by a single backtick or on a new line surrounded by three backtics, or a hyperlink. Or try bolding or italicizing. You could also tag someone if you know their GitHub username. Your post doesn't have to be meaningful.

- Hit Comment when you're done.

- Read the "How to get help" section on the course policies page.

---

## 4. Getting to know you survey

# [bit.ly/sta-212-f19-survey](https://bit.ly/sta-212-f19-survey)

---

## 5. RStudio Cloud accounts

- If you had issues creating your RStudio Cloud account, opening the project, or running the analysis, try it again.

    - Go to [bit.ly/sta-212-f19-rstudio-join](http://bit.ly/sta-212-f19-rstudio-join) and sign in with your GitHub credentials.

## Putting it all together

First, put away computers, and watch me do it:

- Click on the assignment link that you should have received in your email to create your GitHub repository (which we’ll refer to as "repo" going forward) for the assignment. This repo contains a template you can build on to complete your assignment.

- On GitHub, click on the green **Clone or download button**, select **Use HTTPS** (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you’ll see the text **Clone with HTTPS** as in the image below). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

- Go to RStudio Cloud and into the course workspace. Create a **New Project from Git Repo**. You will need to click on the down arrow next to the **New Project** button to see this option.

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the pop up dialog box.

- Hit OK.

Now it's your turn! Place a green sticky on your laptop when you're done with this part (you can continue if you like). Place a red sticky if you have questions.

---

## Housekeeping

First, put away computers, and watch me do it:

- Go to the Terminal pane

- Type the following two lines of code, replacing the information in the quotation marks with your info:

```
git config --global user.email "your email"
git config --global user.name "your name"
```

- To confirm that the changes have been implemented, run the following

```
git config --global user.email
git config --global user.name
```

Now it's your turn! Place a green sticky on your laptop when you're done with this part (you can continue if you like). Place a red sticky if you have questions.
