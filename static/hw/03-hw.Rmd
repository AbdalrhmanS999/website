For the final project, you will need to select an appropriate **dataset** to analyze. This dataset should meet the following criteria:

* Has at least 6 variables
* Has both numeric and categorical variables
* Has a decent number of observations (at least $n = 75$)

Some places you can find data:

* Data included in the `Stat2Data` R package (that meet the above criteria)
* Data from [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com)
* Biomedical data from [Vanderbilt's Biostatistics Repository](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/DataSets)
* Data you've found elsewhere

You will be exploring fitting at least **three** potential models with this data. Your outcome variable can be either **binary** or **numeric**.
